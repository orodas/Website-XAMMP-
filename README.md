# Website-XAMMP-
This is an example of a website created using the programming languages HTML, PHP, and SQL.
I'm using XAMPP for testing, developing, and server funtionality.
So far users can create an account by registering a unique username and a password.
They can also sign in using their credentials to gain acces to the main page.
Next I will implement the features of the website (still being determined - will update later).
