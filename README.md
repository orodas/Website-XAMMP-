# Website-XAMMP-
This is an example of a website created using the programming languages HTML, PHP, and SQL.
I'm using XAMPP for testing, developing, and server funtionality.
So far users can create an account by registering a unique username and a password.
They can also sign in using their credentials to gain acces to the main page.
Next I will implement the features of the website (still being determined - will update later).
EDIT February 3rd, 2019 - I have now implemented a user-interactable table. Users may create a list and store it in a database,
with the ability to add, update, and delete entires. I used jQuery and AJAX for all the table functions.
